= has_ip_address

An extension to ActiveRecord to store IP Addresses in the database as integers, in part to IPAddr.

    class Visit < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_ip_address
    end

Here's an example of using it:

    >> visit = Visit.new
    => #<Visit id: nil, ip_address: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
    >> visit.ip_address = "127.0.0.1"
    => "127.0.0.1"
    >> visit.ip_address
    => #<IPAddr: IPv4:127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255>
    >> visit.ip_address.to_i
    => 2130706433
    >> visit.ip_address.to_s
    => "127.0.0.1"

This assumes you are using a column named :ip_address. To change this behavior, pass in a parameter with the column you care to use:


    class Visit < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_ip_address :visit_ip
    end

== Known issues

 * Setting ip_address to an invalid IP address will fail with an ArgumentError from IPAddr.
   * Ideally, it should let you pass any value in without error, but invalid IP addresses will add a validation error during validation
   * In the mean time, you probably want to only this when the IP Address will definitely be correct, ie from a controller's `request.remote_ip`.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
