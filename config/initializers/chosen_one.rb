# For the brave souls who get this far: You are the chosen ones,
# the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest,
# fixing our most awful code. To you, true saviors, kings of men,
# I say this: never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,
# never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry,
# never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
